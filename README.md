Cellular automaton model to investigate reductions in COVID-19 infection rate with spatial and temporal physical distancing

This R code produces an RÃ—C matrix populated by N individuals.

For each cell, individual is resampled from a maximum of half the matrix dimension, with each movement conditioned a binomial probability set by the user.
 
The process can be run over t time steps and s iterations. 

Note, there is no recovery component included.
 
The user can define two additional parameters:
 
1. A reduction in movement probability (spatial distancing)
2. A reduction of in exposure (temporal distancing)
